# reductionist-view-reduce

I've decided to write my own reduce function with the following goals in mind:

* Really understand the reduce function which is so commonly used
* Understand how other core functions like map & filter in turn use the reduce method: their differences and similarities
* Continue to improve Clojure skilss
